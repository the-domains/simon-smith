# ABOUT THE FILM

Ahora o Nunca is a rollicking romantic comedy with a large, all star 
cast. Starring Dani Rovira and Maria Valverde, it followed directly the
huge success of Dani Rovira's Ocho Apellidos Vascos. It was one of the 
hotly anticipated films for 2015 and was seen by 1.3 million people, , 
staying in the top 10 for 8 weeks. It made over 8 million at the box 
office which was a new record for a female film director in Spain. It 
features a host of top spanish comic actors, including Joaquin Nu√±ez, 
Jordi Sanchez, Gracia Olaya, Yolanda Ramos, Ana Gras, Clara Lago and 
many more.

It is set principally in the UK and based around a wedding plan that 
goes wrong for everyone through a series of mishaps and misadventures 
that get increasingly ridiculous as everybody tries to make it to the 
wedding in one piece.
