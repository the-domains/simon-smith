# ABOUT THE PROJECT

This beautifully crafted animation is a free interpretation of a 
Kafkian tale "before the law". A peasant comes across a huge gate with a
fearsome guardian and wishes to pass.

N9ve gave me total freedom to create something for their piece. I 
decided I wanted to explore atonal and abstract early 20th century 
music, the jarring, tense, rich and uncomfortable sounds of exploring 
the boundaries of tonal and atonal compositions. I thought it would 
marry well with the austere and strange hand-drawn world of the story, 
and set the tone for the dark, sad tale.

# ABOUT THE MUSIC

I asked long-time collaborator Sasha Agranov to come in to record 
fragments of guided and free improvisations on his baroque cello, that I
later sculpted in many layers into the final music, and we had an 
amazingly productive session. His input was so brilliant, including 
long sections of improvised melodies that fitted perfectly, that I asked
N9ve to change the composing credit to include Sasha.
